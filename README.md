# Differential Privacy-Hyperdimensional Computing (DP-HD)

This repository contains the code for **Differential Privacy-Hyperdimensional Computing (DP-HD)**, a novel framework that integrates Explainable AI (XAI) with vector symbolic paradigms to effectively quantify and predict the impact of Differential Privacy (DP) noise on model accuracy using a Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) metric.

DP-HD enables precise tuning of privacy noise levels, achieving an optimal balance between data privacy and AI model performance. It has been validated using real-world Additive Manufacturing (AM) datasets, demonstrating exceptional accuracy and robust privacy protection even under significant noise conditions.

## Key Features

- **Differential Privacy (DP)**: Introduces mathematically controlled noise to protect sensitive data.
- **Hyperdimensional Computing (HDC)**: Uses high-dimensional vectors to efficiently represent and process data.
- **Explainable AI (XAI)**: Offers transparency on how privacy settings affect model accuracy, assisting in clear decision-making for privacy-performance trade-offs.
- **Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) Metric**: Enables predictive quantification of noise impacts to optimize DP parameters.

## Applications

- **Additive Manufacturing Monitoring**: Real-time anomaly detection with high accuracy and robust privacy protection.
- Suitable for other privacy-sensitive fields including healthcare, financial services, and government data management.
